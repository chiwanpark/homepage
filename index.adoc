== Experience
+++NAVER Cloud Corp. Hyperscale AI Team (Dec. 2025 - Now)+++::
To be updated soon.

+++Kakao Corp. AI Alignment Unit (Apr. 2024 - Dec. 2025)+++::
I was involved in building https://mate.kakao.com[AI Mate], a conversational agent designed to deliver personalized recommendations and assistance across various Kakao services. My contributions focused on developing a production-grade Korean conversational agent, where my key contributions included:
1. Implementing a versatile inference system capable of leveraging multiple backend engines, including vLLM, SGLang, and TensorRT-LLM. This allowed us to efficiently serve a diverse range of LLMs, utilizing the optimal engine for each specific model's requirements.
2. Performing extensive evaluations of various LLMs in terms of their agentic capabilities in real-world scenarios, including task accuracy, output format adherence, and response quality. This evaluation process was crucial for selecting the most suitable models for our conversational agent.
3. Designing a fine-tuning technique specifically for multi-agent scenarios. This method enabled the creation and operation of multiple distinct agents from a single base language model, crucially ensuring they function without interfering with one another.

+++Kakao Corp. R&D Center (Apr. 2018 - May. 2021)<br/>Kakao Corp. Advanced Recommendation Technology (ART) Team (May. 2021 - Mar. 2024)+++::
As unit lead within the Kakao ART Team, I managed a research unit of over 10 members, responsible for developing and maintaining recommender systems across various Kakao services, including social networking, digital comics, e-commerce, and news platforms. My key contributions included:
1. Developing a lightweight user representation model for link:https://daum.net[Daum], a popular news portal with 10 million users, by leveraging topic keywords from articles to capture evolving user interests. This model served as a context input feature for bandit models, enhancing news recommendation quality.
2. Building personalized recommender systems for link:https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/detail/9462[mm], an audio-only social network service. I employed graph-based recommendation models, incorporating techniques like graph pruning and regularization to optimize performance.
3. Addressing cold-start issues for new comics on link:https://webtoon.kakao.com[Kakao Webtoon] and link:https://piccoma.com[Piccoma] by combining content-based representation learning and collaborative filtering. These recommender systems served as user-targeted marketing tools, optimizing the first conversion rate.
4. Creating a context-aware recommender system for link:https://gift.kakao.com[KakaoTalk Gift], an e-commerce feature within the KakaoTalk Messenger app. The system considered multiple contexts such as demographics, product popularity, and user history (including clicked and purchased items), by integrating text and image embedding alongside collaborative filtering techniques.
5. Developing and maintaining machine learning applications for link:https://shoppinghow.kakao.com[Shopping How], an eBay/Amazon-like e-commerce platform. I implemented product categorization and matching systems using Transformers and graph algorithms, applying parallel computing techniques to efficiently handle billion-scale data.
