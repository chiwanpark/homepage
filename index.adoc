[.biography]
== Biography
I'm an Applied Machine Learning Engineer at the AI Vertical Solution of link:http://www.kakaocorp.com[Kakao Corporation], where I'm building machine learning applications for various mobile and web services of Kakao.
My research interests include applications of large-scale language-vision models, conversational recommender systems, and machine learning on graphs.
I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University, where I conducted research on large-scale graph processing using distributed systems under the guidance of link:https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/~ukang/[Prof. U Kang].
For more details about my research achievements, please refer to my full link:https://bit.ly/chiwanpark-cv[Curriculum Vitae].

In my free time, I have developed data-related products.
link:https://solvesql.com[SolveSQL], a web-based SQL learning platform for data analysts, is publicly available.
I have contributed to open-source data processing tools such as link:https://flink.apache.org/[Apache Flink], link:https://sqoop.apache.org/[Apache Sqoop], and link:https://mrql.apache.org/[Apache MRQL].

+++Kakao Corp. AI Vertical Solution Unit (Apr. 2024 - Now)+++::
To be announced.

+++Kakao Corp. R&D Center (Apr. 2018 - May. 2021)<br/>Kakao Corp. Advanced Recommendation Technology (ART) Team (May. 2021 - Mar. 2024)+++::
As the unit lead of a research unit within the Kakao ART Team, I managed a group of 10+ individuals responsible for developing and maintaining recommender systems across various Kakao services, including social networking, digital comics, e-commerce, and news platforms. My key experiences and contributions include:
1. Developing a lightweight user representation model for link:https://daum.net[Daum], a popular news portal service with 10 million users, by leveraging important keywords from user-read articles to capture evolving user interests. The output of model served as a context input feature for bandit models, enhancing news recommendation quality.
1. Building personalized recommender systems for link:https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/detail/9462[mm], an audio-only social network services like Clubhouse. I employed graph-based recommendation models, incorporating techniques like graph pruning and regularization to optimize performance.
1. Combining content-based representation learning and collaborative filtering to address cold-start issues for new comics on link:https://webtoon.kakao.com[Kakao Webtoon] and link:https://piccoma.com[Piccoma] in Korea and Japan. The recommender systems served as a user-targeted marketing tools, optimizing the first conversion rate.
1. Creating a context-aware recommender system for link:https://gift.kakao.com[Kakaotalk Gift], an e-commerce platform for sending gifts throught Kakaotalk messenger. The system considered multiple contexts such as demographics, product popularity, and user history including clicked and purchased items, by integrating text and image embedding along with collaborative filtering techniques.
1. Developing and maintaining machine learning applications for link:https://shoppinghow.kakao.com[shoppinghow], an e-commerce platform similar to eBay and Amazon. I implemented product categorization and matching systems using Transformers and graph algorithms, applying parallel computing techniques to handling billion-scale data efficiently.
