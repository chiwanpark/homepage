[.experience]
== Experience
+++Kakao Corp. AI Alignment Unit (Apr. 2024 - Now)+++::
I am currently involved in building https://mate.kakao.com[AI Mate], a conversational agent designed to deliver personalized recommendations and assistance across various Kakao services. My contributions focus on developing a production-grade Korean conversational agent, where my key contributions include:
1. Implemented a versatile inference system capable of leveraging multiple backend engines, including vLLM, SGLang, and TensorRT-LLM. This allows us to efficiently serve a diverse range of LLMs, utilizing the optimal engine for each specific model's requirements.
2. Designed a fine-tuning technique specifically for multi-agent scenarios. This method enables the creation and operation of multiple distinct agents from a single base language model, crucially ensuring they function without interfering with one another.

+++Kakao Corp. R&D Center (Apr. 2018 - May. 2021)<br/>Kakao Corp. Advanced Recommendation Technology (ART) Team (May. 2021 - Mar. 2024)+++::
As unit lead within the Kakao ART Team, I managed a research unit of over 10 members, responsible for developing and maintaining recommender systems across various Kakao services, including social networking, digital comics, e-commerce, and news platforms. Some key contributions include:
1. Developed a lightweight user representation model for link:https://daum.net[Daum], a popular news portal with 10 million users, by leveraging topic keywords from articles to capture evolving user interests. This model served as a context input feature for bandit models, enhancing news recommendation quality.
2. Built personalized recommender systems for link:https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/detail/9462[mm], an audio-only social network service like Clubhouse. I employed graph-based recommendation models, incorporating techniques like graph pruning and regularization to optimize performance.
3. Addressed cold-start issues for new comics on link:https://webtoon.kakao.com[Kakao Webtoon] and link:https://piccoma.com[Piccoma] by combining content-based representation learning and collaborative filtering. These recommender systems served as user-targeted marketing tools, optimizing the first conversion rate.
4. Created a context-aware recommender system for link:https://gift.kakao.com[Kakaotalk Gift], an e-commerce feature within Kakaotalk Messenger. The system considered multiple contexts such as demographics, product popularity, and user history including clicked and purchased items, by integrating text and image embedding alongside collaborative filtering techniques.
5. Developed and maintained machine learning applications for link:https://shoppinghow.kakao.com[shoppinghow], an eBay/Amazon-like e-commerce platform. I implemented product categorization and matching systems using Transformers and graph algorithms, applying parallel computing techniques to efficiently handle billion-scale data.
